project_blurb: "[Wireshark]({{ project_url }}) is the world’s foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what’s happening on your network at a microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies, and educational institutions. Wireshark development thrives thanks to the volunteer contributions of networking experts around the globe and is the continuation of a project started by Gerald Combs in 1998. "

# application setup block
app_setup_block_enabled: true
app_setup_block: |
  The application can be accessed at:
  
  * http://yourhost:3000/
  
  By default the user/pass is abc/abc, if you change your password or want to login manually to the GUI session for any reason use the following link:
  
  * http://yourhost:3000/?login=true
  
  In order to dump from an interface you will need to pass `NET_ADMIN` at a minimum, optionally you can use host networking to capture from your host level device or specify a Docker network you want to capture from.
  
  If you do not specificy host networking you will need to map port 3000 with `-p 3000:3000`.
